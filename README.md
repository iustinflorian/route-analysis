# **C++ Programming: Route Optimization and Cost Analysis**<br />
## **Objective**<br />
Optimize travel routes across Great Britain, connecting capitals of member states, and analyze associated costs.<br />
## **Tasks**<br />
- [x] Calculate minimum travel distance between capitals.<br />
- [x] Determine transportation cost based on car consumption (7.8L/100 km) and petrol cost (£1.7/L).<br />
- [x] Schedule driver breaks and calculate how far the car can cover the minimum distance within legal limits.<br />
- [x] Export cost data in pounds, dollars, euros, and lei, along with driving hours and distance information.<br />
